<h3>How can I add a book to the IndieBound title database?</h3>
<p>As you may know, <strong>IndieBound</strong> is a program of the <strong>American Booksellers Association (ABA)</strong>, a trade association representing thousands of independent bookstores. The purpose of the site is primarily to help customers find indie locations and purchase from independent bookstores.</p>
<p>ABA has two main online retail programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>We support websites for hundreds of bookstores through a program called <strong>IndieCommerce</strong>. Getting your book listed on IndieBound.org will make it available on IndieCommerce sites as well.</li>
<li>We also have a partnership with <strong>Ingram</strong> and <strong>AddLibra</strong> to support direct-to-consumer sales on <strong>IndieBound.org</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, we strongly recommend that you look into getting your book carried by Ingram. If Ingram has your book in its warehouses, it will be available to ship direct-to-consumer through IndieCommerce sites and IndieBound.org. Ingram is also the primary provider of the book metadata on IndieBound.org and on IndieCommerce sites. Once your arrangements have been finalized with Ingram, we should begin to receive metadata for your book.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can add books to the IndieBound.org database. Our staff will review and approve the title before it appears on the site, which can take a business day or two. For more details visit <a href="http://www.bookweb.org/indiecommerce/adding-books-database">http://www.bookweb.org/indiecommerce/adding-books-database</a>.</p>
<p><a name="nextlist" style="display: block; position: relative; visibility: hidden; top: -30px;" id="nextlist"></a></p>
<h3>Can my book be considered for the Indie Next List?</h3>
<p>Indie bookstore members of the American Booksellers Association nominate books for the Indie Next List by sending blurbs to ABA. We then compile the list based on the nominations. Any store can nominate any book, although most nominate those titles they learn about from publishers who work with ABA and send galleys and finished books to the members, often through a monthly mailing that ABA organizes. You can find out more about how ABA works with publishers here: <a href="http://www.bookweb.org/aba-publisher-partner-program">www.bookweb.org/aba-publisher-partner-program</a></p>
<p><a name="support" style="display: block; position: relative; visibility: hidden; top: -30px;" id="support"></a></p>
<h3>I am a publisher. How can I support independent bookstores?</h3>
<p>Publishers can support independent bookstores by linking, and asking their authors to link, to IndieBound.org for book sales. You can become an affiliate and earn referral fees, or link to a book product page without becoming an affiliate. Links, options, and details are at <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/spread-word">https://www.indiebound.org/spread-word</a>. Or click on the button on the homepage that says "Link to IndieBound".</p>
<p><a name="linkto" style="display: block; position: relative; visibility: hidden; top: -30px;" id="linkto"></a></p>
<h3>How do I link to IndieBound.org for book sales?</h3>
<p>You can become an affiliate and earn referral fees, or link to a book product page without becoming an affiliate. Links, options, and details are at <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/spread-word">https://www.indiebound.org/spread-word</a>. Or click on the button on the homepage that says "Link to IndieBound".</p>
<p><a name="review" style="display: block; position: relative; visibility: hidden; top: -30px;" id="review"></a></p>
<h3>Can I submit a review or a blurb about a book, for the site or for the Indie Next List?</h3>
<p>IndieBound.org does not accept outside book reviews. All book data on the site, including descriptions and reviews, are part of a data feed we receive from Ingram Content Group and publishers.</p>
<p><a name="correct" style="display: block; position: relative; visibility: hidden; top: -30px;" id="correct"></a></p>
<h3>How can I correct bibliodata that is wrong or incomplete?</h3>
<p>We offer an online form for editing data for existing books. Edits made here will be put into a queue for our staff to review and approve before they appear on the site. However, it is crucial that you also provide any corrections to Ingram (if your book is available through them). Because Ingram provides our metadata, if they submit an update to us subsequently containing the error you corrected, it will overwrite your correction. For more details visit <a href="http://www.bookweb.org/indiecommerce/adding-books-database">http://www.bookweb.org/indiecommerce/adding-books-database</a>.</p>
<p><a name="icba" style="display: block; position: relative; visibility: hidden; top: -30px;" id="icba"></a></p>
<h3>How do I nominate my book for the Indies Choice Book Awards?</h3>
<p>The Indies Choice Book Awards are chosen only from books appearing on the Indie Next List. Indie bookstore members of the American Booksellers Association nominate books for the Indie Next List by sending blurbs to ABA. We then compile the list based on the nominations. Any member store can nominate any book, although most nominate those titles they learn about from publishers who work with ABA and send galleys and finished books to the members, often through a monthly mailing that ABA organizes. You can find out more about how ABA works with publishers here: <a href="http://www.bookweb.org/aba-publisher-partner-program">www.bookweb.org/aba-publisher-partner-program</a></p>

<h3>I am an independent or self-published author. How do I get my book on the Indie Bestseller list, or market my books to independent bookstores?</h3>
<p>The Indie Bestseller list is based on reporting from independent bookstore members of the American Booksellers Association. Most stores report sales through their POS systems, regardless of where the book is sold, online or in-store. To make the list your book will need to be carried -- and sold, of course -- by the stores reporting to the list. Here is an article with tips from Ingram on how to market to indies: <a href="http://www.ingramspark.com/blog/marketing-your-book-to-bookstores">http://www.ingramspark.com/blog/marketing-your-book-to-bookstores</a>. Here is another piece with advice from a regional bookseller association: <a href="https://writerswin.com/market-book-independent-bookstores/">https://writerswin.com/market-book-independent-bookstores/</a></p>
<p><a name="carry" style="display: block; position: relative; visibility: hidden; top: -30px;" id="carry"></a></p>
<h3>How can I get independent bookstores to carry my book?</h3>
<p>There are many ways to work with independent bookstores. Approach a local store and ask if they have a program for independent authors, or a consignment program. Market yourself on social media and develop a following. Be sure the book is what the customer and the store are looking for.</p>
<p>Here is an article with tips from Ingram on how to market to indies: <a href="http://www.ingramspark.com/blog/marketing-your-book-to-bookstores">http://www.ingramspark.com/blog/marketing-your-book-to-bookstores</a>.</p>
<p>Here is another piece with advice from a regional bookseller association: <a href="https://writerswin.com/market-book-independent-bookstores">https://writerswin.com/market-book-independent-bookstores</a>.</p>
<p>Advertising to stores through the American Booksellers Association is also an option. Visit <a href="http://www.bookweb.org/advertising-mailing-list">www.BookWeb.org</a> for more information.</p>
<p><a name="createspace" style="display: block; position: relative; visibility: hidden; top: -30px;" id="createspace"></a></p>
<h3>I made my book at Create Space. Can I get it listed on IndieBound.org and/or can I become an affiliate?</h3>
<p>Yes and Yes. In either case you will need to be sure your book is on hand at Ingram so sales can be fulfilled. Create Space may help with that through its Expanded Distribution program: <a href="https://www.createspace.com/Products/Book/ExpandedDistribution.jsp">https://www.createspace.com/Products/Book/ExpandedDistribution.jsp</a>.</p>
<p><a name="ingram" style="display: block; position: relative; visibility: hidden; top: -30px;" id="ingram"></a></p>
<h3>I can't/won't/don't want to work with Ingram. Isn't there some other way to get my book listed here?</h3>
<p>Yes. We offer an online form for adding titles to our site. Books added in this way will appear on IndieBound.org; however, they will not be available for direct purchase through the site. Books in our system that are not carried by Ingram will also appear on local store sites, but whether they are available for direct purchase there is entirely dependent on each individual store. For more details visit <a href="http://www.bookweb.org/indiecommerce/adding-books-database">http://www.bookweb.org/indiecommerce/adding-books-database</a>.</p>
<p><a name="copyright" style="display: block; position: relative; visibility: hidden; top: -30px;" id="copyright"></a></p>
<h3>One of the titles on IndieBound.org violates my copyright and I’d like it removed. What recourse do I have?</h3>
<p>IndieBound licenses the title database from Ingram Content Group and receives direct title feeds from many publishers. Therefore, the claim must be dealt with at the source or it will continue to appear on our website. If you have a legitimate copyright infringement claim, with backup documentation, you should work with Ingram and/or the publisher directly to resolve the issue and remove the infringing work from the database. In the meantime, please <a href="mailto:copyright@bookweb.org">email IndieBound</a> with evidence of your claim for evaluation.</p>
